Gameplay
- Enemies sneaking up to you because the tile blends in with the background is not fun.
  - Triage: Interrupt game when an enemy comes into view, dismissable by a specific key (say, enter by default), and able to be turned off in the options. 
  - Triage: Add outline to bats
- Walking into a wall or trying to use a power you can't afford still takes a turn.
- Exploit: Staying in town and kill things right by the free healing priest for xp
- Improve Jump: is there any reason not to jump literally every move?
  - Add cooldown to jump
  - Make it only useful in battle or moving around
  - When not in combat, should be the same as moving

User Interface
- Cannot move cursors with WASD pad when targetting for instance
- The range where you can move the cursor in the 'f' fire mode doesn't respect your weapon's max range.
- S to go down is weird even if WASD makes sense. But diagonals are used a lot in the game. 
  - Consider WADX instead.
- . to attack is awkward when using arrow keys, and might be hard to find, easy to miss with , too

Audio
- Boss battle midi gets bugged on loop
